# Abstract
  Going fast have always been an important topic. With recently technology advancement of autonomous car, we found the need to go faster... without a driver
  The scope of the project is to ultilize ForzaETH repo and integrating with lidar vision in-order to adapt the car to every track without physical traning. the car will map out the track layout and will compute the best possible way to get around the track.

# What We Promised
- Optimizing Vehicle Racing Performance using SLAM and EKF with Artemis IMU and VESC outputs.
- Creating a optimal trajectory raceline with an algorithm and following the path using Pure - Pursuit/Model and Acceleration-based Pursuit controllers. Based on ForzaETH repo.

# Accomplishments 
- Lidar Integration
- SLAM Integration

# Challenges
- Initial project scope was to use V-SLAM to map out the track but V-SLAM is computationally heavy and would require Xavier NX, would take up a lot of time to build from scratch
# Final Project Video

# Software
- Lidar Node
- ForzaETH "rack_stack" in ROS environment
- Forza docker container on ROS1
- Modified node for VESC

# Hardware:
## Standard
- Traxxas Chassis
  -  steering servo
  -  sensored brushless DC motor
  -  DC-DC Converter
  -  4-cell Lipo Battery
Jetson Nano
Sparkfun Artemis IMU
Flipsky VESC 4.12
